## What is ByteDetective?
ByteDetective is a **desktop app** (currently available for MacOS) that acts as a **semantic search engine for your photos**. The aim is to make searching for images on your desktop quick and easy. 

**Images are difficult to search**; they often don't have a really intuitive filename, and you have to dig a lot to find them. Wouldn't it make more sense to search for them **based on their content** (e.g "eating pizza with friends")?

Why it's cool:
- üìÅ **Ease of use**: Say goodbye to the endless struggle of navigating through countless files and folders to find that one picture
- üîÆ **Intelligent**: Even if your description is vague, ByteDetective will deliver pretty decent results, giving you images that match your words.
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Lightning-fast performance as the inference is made with Rust.

## How it works

## Demo 
https://github.com/ssantoshp/ByteDetective/assets/61618641/9e1af1cd-8cf6-4f58-ae82-c4b826db50e1

## How to use
1. Download the release.
2. Open it.
3. Give the app authorizations to access your files. 
4. Leave it open for a few hours. At first, it will take a little time to scan all the images on your computer. Then it will get faster and synchronize with new images on the fly, promise.
